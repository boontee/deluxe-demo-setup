# IBM Business Automation Manager Open Edition Workflow Demo Setup

Start from this repository to clone and run the attached scripts to clone the necessary repositories.

To fully run the demonstration, you will need to utilize an email server. The recommendation since this is for demonstration purposes is to use something like FakeSMTP ["download here"](http://nilhcem.github.io/FakeSMTP/downloads/fakeSMTP-latest.zip). Once this is downloaded, it can be ran by unzipping it and running  

```shell
java -jar fakeSMTP.jar
```
